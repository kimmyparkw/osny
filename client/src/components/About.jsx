                of all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds can find<br/>
                the perfect piece to reinvent or maintain their look.</p>

                    Our Values:<br/>
                    We believe in integrity, inclusivity, sustainability<br/>
                    diversity, accessibility, and giving that<br/>
                    little something extra to make someone's day.<br/>
                    We understand the responsibility that comes with reselling<br/>
                    thrifted goods. We support local thrift stores without<br/>
                    them clean and making sure to leave plenty of "the good stuff"<br/>
                    for the people who rely on the low prices that the<br/>
                    thrift stores regularly provide.

                    Kimmy Park-Wolmarans has a background in<br/>
                    fashion design and software engineering.<br/>
                    Her newfound consciousness of sustainable fashion<br/>
                    and love of thrifting pushed her to start her own<br/>
                    business: Old Souls || New You.
