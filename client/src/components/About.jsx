                <p>Our Mission:<br/>
                We strive to provide a safe space where people<br/>
                of all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds can find<br/>
                the perfect piece to reinvent or maintain their look.</p>

                    Our Values:<br/>
                    We believe in integrity, inclusivity, sustainability<br/>
                    diversity, accessibility, and giving that<br/>
                    little something extra to make someone's day.

                    The Owner:<br/>
                    Kimmy Park-Wolmarans was tired of seeing brands<br/>
                    market themselves as sustainable while charging absurd prices.<br/>
                    The same went for the super cute vintage shops<br/>
                    that would buy items at thrift stores for super cheap and then<br/>
                    mark up the price like crazy. Sustainable should mean accessible<br/>
                    and resellers should be conscious of the role they play<br/>
                    in the gentrification of local thrift stores.
