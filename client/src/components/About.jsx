                We strive to provide a safe space where people
                of all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds can find
                the perfect piece to reinvent or maintain their look.</p>

                    Our Values:<br/>
                    We believe in integrity, inclusivity, sustainability
                    diversity, accessibility, and giving that
                    little something extra to make someone's day.
                    We understand the responsibility that comes with reselling
                    thrifted goods. We support local thrift stores without
                    them clean and making sure to leave plenty of "the good stuff"
                    for the people who rely on the low prices that the
                    thrift stores regularly provide.

                    The Owner:<br/>
                    Kimmy Park-Wolmarans has a background in
                    fashion design and software engineering.
                    Her newfound consciousness of sustainable fashion
                    and love of thrifting pushed her to start her own
                    business: Old Souls || New You.
